#1
Please use "npm i" command to install all dependencies.

#2

#3
Go to: http://localhost:3000/

#4
file with example of orders is attached to this repository - data.txt

#simplify:
<ul>
<li>In adding orders, the number of order isn't unique and it can be duplicated</li>
<li>App does not check structure of data in file.</li>
<li>In real app should be created three collections - also with clients and products</li>
<li>The "sales of product ranking" in http://localhost:3000/order/ was made in javascript to show my JS knowledge ;) but if we will operate huge quantity of orders the better way is db aggregation like in endpoint: http://localhost:3000/orders/ranking </li>
</ul>

#
To create this app I used methodology of MVC.
